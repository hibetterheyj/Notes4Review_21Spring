- Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) >= Drones; UAS  = Remotely piolted aircraft systems / autonomous aircraft systems

- Rules in Aviation: Federal Office of Civil Aviation Switzerland

- Everything which is not forbidden is allowed -> Switzerland

  Trust, less difficult for innovation

- 3 Pillar Concept / Drone Categories

  1. Open-Within the legal framework (No Authorization required)
  2. Specific-Not sufficiently safe (Authorization required)
  3. Certified-Approved to accepted standards

- Act

  - **Ordinance on Special Category Aircraft**
    - No authorization required for commercial flights
    - No distinction between Unmanned Aircraft and Model Aircraft
  - **DETEC Ordinance on Special Category Aircraft**
    - No authorization below **30kg**
    - Within direct visual contact (VLOS)
    - Not within a distance <=100m around crowds
  - **ANSP (Skyguide) or Airport responsibility**
    - \> **5km** Distance to civil & military airports/aerodromes
    - < **150m** AGL (Above Ground Level) within a CTR

- Act in EU
  - Open/Specific/Certified
  - Difference
    - restrictions: MTOM **25kg**
    - maximum flying altitude: **120m** 

- Specific Category

  > Application for an operating permit on the basis of the **SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment)**

  **Operational Volume = Flight Geography + Contingency Volume **

- :question: Robustness Levels: Integrity + Assurance

- U-Space

  > The U-space is a collection of decentralized services that collectively aim to safely and efficiently integrate drones into the airspace and enable drone operations alongside manned flight.
