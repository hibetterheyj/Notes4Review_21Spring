# Intro (week1)

## Overview

- Most Civilian Drones are Small

  - flapping wings: operates in small scale; short flight time
  - rotorcraft/multicopters: in medium; could hover in place
  - fixed wings: fixed has longest flight time; cannot hover in place

- but endurance is a challenge

## Fixed wing Staying in the Air

generate a force **Lift** L equal and **opposite** to its own **weight** W

<img src="./pics/aerial/week1_hovering.png" alt="week1_hovering" style="zoom:50%;" />

fixed-wing generates by airflow

- computing **lift**: $W=\frac{1}{2} C^{l} * \rho {*} V^{2} * S \approx 0.3 * 1.25 * V^2 * S$ (sea level)

  - lift coefficient $C^{l}$: proportional to angle of attack

    at cruise speed $6^{\circ}$, assuming $\frac{1}{2} C^{l}= 0.2$ 

  - Air density: decreases with the altitude

     1.25 $kg/m^3$ at sea level

  - Air speed V: fly 2x as fast -> 4x lift

  - Wing area S

- compute the required **velocity** $V = \sqrt{(W / 0.38 * S)}$

- Speed is proportional only to **wing loading** W/S $W/S = 0.38V^2$

## Maintaining constant speed V

- generate a **thrust** force T equal and opposite to **Drag** force D

- Drag  $D=\frac{1}{2} C^{d} * \rho {*} V^{2} * S = \rm{Lift}/r $

  lift-drag ratio $r = Lift/Drag$

## Major Application Fields

- Agriculture
- Energy
- Public safety & security
- Delivery

###For Agriculture

Forcast: parcel delivery > air freight in near future

#### «Can Drones Deliver?»

- Power requirement: 0.59kW

  deliver 2 kg payload at cruising speed of 45 km/h

- Energy requirement: about 0.39kWh

  deliver 2 kg payload within 10 km radius with 30 km/h headwind

  - power (kW) x distance to speed ratio (d/v) to get energy requirement (kWh)

## :ballot_box_with_check: Checkpoints

- For a given total mass, what type of small drones (multi-copter, fixed-wing, flapping  wing) displays the longest endurance?

  fixed-wing

  > fixed-wing drones generate lift with their wings. This means that, unlike a multirotor drone, they don't expend large amounts of energy just to stay in the air and fly more efficiently as a result

- How much faster must an intercontinental airplane fly at cruising altitude compared to sea level?

  $W=\frac{1}{2} C^{l} * \rho {*} V^{2} * S \rightarrow V = \sqrt{\frac{2W}{C^l \rho S}}$

  - sea level: $\rho = 1.25kg/m^3$
  - intercontinental airplane fly ~10000m: $\rho = 0.4135kg/m^3$

- What structural factor (i.e. not the engine) affects the cruising speed of fixed-wing  drones?

  Speed is only proportional to wing loding (W/S) = Weight/Wing area

- What are the two major drone applications in agriculture?

  Inspection and spraying

- What are the drone applications in the energy sector?

  Stationary inspection; long-range inspection; and power generation

- What are the factors to consider for calculating the cost/km of drone delivery?

  Electricity cost and battery cost

| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Examples** | airplanes, gliders | new robots                | helicopters, multicopters            |
| **Pros**     | Fast; Efficient    | Efficient                 | Can hover;Highly maneuverable        |
| **Cons**     | Cannot Hover       | Hard to build and control | Less efficient                       |

## Introduction

### Rotorcrafts (helicopters vs multicopters)

> generates lift using high speed rotary blades called rotors

- Features

  - Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL)
  - Very maneuverable
  - Less efficient than fixed wing vehicle

- helicopters-Need complex variable pitch rotors

  - the tail produce a moment to counteract the force generated by main propeller blade when generating main lift
  - change the pitch of the blades (force vector) to produce translation-add complexity

- multicopters-Use multiple fixed-pitch blades

  - each spin in different directions; don't need tails due to balanced moment
  - fix pitch propellers 

  > overtaken by helicopters due to heavy workload of the pilot

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros-Easy to build and maintain

- Mechanically simple
- Does not require any complex mechanical parts
- Can move around by changing motor speed
- Can hover, takeoff, and land vertically

#### Cons

- Required energy constantly to hover
- **less efficient** than helicopters of the same size because the **thrust is generated by smaller propellers**.

## Structure and Physics

### Main components

frame; control board; Motors and motor drivers (ESC, electronic speed controller); Propellers; Battery; Receiver

### Configuration

- Four propellers generate four lift forces

- Propellers 1& 2 (CCW) have opposite pitch compared to propellers 3 & 4 (CW)

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week1_frame.png" alt="week1_frame" style="zoom:80%;" />

### Rotation speeds / Forces / Moments

> movement are controlled by changing the rotation speed of the propellers

- Force F is **proportional to square of** propeller **speed** $F_i \propto w_i^2$
- mg is the **weight** of the quadrotor
- **Moments** generated by the forces are $M_i = L \propto F_i$

<img src="./pics/aerial/week1_force.png" alt="week1_force" style="zoom:40%;" />

### Hover conditions

1. All forces must be balanced $F_1+ F_2+ F_3+ F_4+ mg = 0$

   move up and down

2. Lift forces must be parallel to gravity $F_i \Vert g$

3. All moments must be balanced $M_1+M_2+M_3+M_4 = 0$

   pitch and roll

4. Rotor speeds must be balanced (torque balanced) $(w1+w3)-(w2+w4) =0$

   yaw

## Flight mechanics

> How to move a quadrotor around?

- **Orientation**

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week1_rpy.png" alt="week1_rpy" style="zoom:50%;" />


> Violating one or more of these conditions implies that **the quadcopter starts to move**

### Moving Up and Down

- **condition1**: Forces Not balanced $F_1+ F_2+ F_3+ F_4+ mg \neq 0$

### Rotating in Yaw

<img src="./pics/aerial/week1_rollpitch.png" alt="week1_rollpitch" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Rotor speeds not balanced (torque balanced) $(w1+w3)-(w2+w4) \neq 0$

  $\dot{\psi}=k_{\psi}\left(\left({w}_{2}+{w}_{4}\right)-\left({w}_{1}+{w}_{3}\right)\right)$

- Note: opposite motor pair should increase/decrease motor speeds to keep hovering, or it will keep flying up!

### Rotation in Roll/Pitch

- Forces not parallel to gravity $F_i \nparallel mg $

- moments not balanced $M_1+M_2+M_3+M_4 \neq 0$

  $\dot{\phi}=k_{\phi}\left(\left(w_{1}+w_{4}\right)-\left(w_{2}+w_{3}\right)\right)$

  $\dot{\theta}=k_{\theta}\left(\left(w_{1}+w_{2}\right)-\left(w_{3}+w_{4}\right)\right)$

### Summary of equations

<img src="./pics/aerial/week1_speed2motion.png" alt="week1_speed2motion" style="zoom:80%;" />

- to control the quadrotor state -> setting the rotor speeds for obtaining a desired angular rotation

  **inverse** operation

### Example-Translated flight

> Moving Forward
>
> Translated flight **requires more thrust than hovering**, but not always more power (see section 6)!

- pitch down: decrease F_1 and F_2

- hover: increase F_1 and F_2 to stop rotation

- translate: keep balance between mg and thrust $\mathbf{F} \cos \theta=-m g$

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week1_move.png" alt="week1_move" style="zoom:40%;" />

- pitch back

## Types of Multicopters

> main feature; fully actuated multicopters

### Configuration

<img src="./pics/aerial/week1_config.png" alt="week1_config" style="zoom:40%;" />

- Tricopter

  - More yaw authority compared to quadcopters

    direct control of yaw

  - More complex mechanical design due to the **servo** in tail

    need additional servo to roll/pitch the back motor

- Hexacopter/Octacopter

  - More lifting capacity -> more payload
  - **Redundancy**, so robust to failure
  - Larger size; expensive

- X8 configuration

  - More lifting capacity
  - **More efficiency** thanks to the **coaxial configurations**

### Fully Actuated Multicopters

> underactuated multicopters -> all propellers are rotated in the same plane

#### Features

- Rotors disks are in different planes
- Fully Actuated to control 6 DoF (heave, roll, pitch and yaw, x and y translation) by using 6 motors

#### Pros

- Translational and rotational **dynamics** are **decoupled**
- **improved robustness to disturbances** and to perform complex manipulation tasks
- Possibility to plan **more complex trajectories**

#### Cons

- Decreased energetic efficiency

## Energetics

> What is the power consumption of a multicopter during flight?
>
> How to extend multicopters flight time?

- Multicopters have high power requirements

  inefficient compared to fixed-wing or flapping-wing aircraft

  - consume about 200 W/kg on average

  - Centimeter scale quad with LiPo -> 5-7min

  - Decimeter scale quad with LiPo ->20-30min

    changes corresponding to **weather conditions** and **aggressiveness of flight**

### Energy in hovering

<img src="./pics/aerial/week1_energetics.png" alt="week1_energetics" style="zoom:67%;" />

- Power calculation of single motor when drone in hovering
  - Propeller efficiency ranges from 0.85 to about 0.9
  - $r_p \sqrt{\pi}$ is the squire root of the disk area
- Flight time
  - $P_i$ has high variability

### Energy in forward flight of quadcopter

- Power consumption during forward flight normalized by the power consumption at hover

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week1_translation_flight.png" alt="week1_translation_flight" style="zoom: 33%;" />

  - lower power need but higher thrust -> aerodynamics

    tilting the quad to the side -> **artificially increase the angle of attack -> generate the increase in thrust in the given power**

  - high power ratio again

    drag increases quickly again!

### Increase flight time

1. Weight and drag reduction

2. Increase the specific power of the energy source

   switch from LiPo batteries to gasoline (far more energy stored)

3. Docking station for charging/battery swapping

4. Tether for power supply

   reduce battery

5. Improving efficiency via mechanical

6. Energy aware motion planning

   reduce acceleration (aggressive flight)

7. Multi-modal operation

   perching; walking and rolling

## :ballot_box_with_check: Checkpoints

- What set of conditions corresponds to hovering in a quadcopter?

  Four conditions: balanced weight; parallel to weight; balanced moment (thrust x half frame); balanced rotation speed

- What set of conditions corresponds to a rotation around the yaw axis in a quadcopter?

  imbalanced rotation speed

- How the time of flight of multicopters can be increased?

- How the power consumption and total thrust evolve at different forward speeds in multicopters?

  first goes down as thus increases when angle of attack increases

  then goes down because the drag force increases again

# Attitude representations (week2)

<img src="./pics/aerial/week2_frame.png" alt="week2_frame" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- how to convert state variables from body frame to earth frame

## 3D Attitude representation- Euler Angles

- Rotation matrices can be parametrize by Euler Angles

  - Roll $\phi$: rotation around x
  - Pitch $\theta$: rotation around y
  - Yaw $\psi$: rotation around z

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week2_euler.png" alt="week2_euler" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- Yaw-Pitch-Roll rotation matrix (Z,Y,X) or Heading-Pitch-Roll (h-p-r)

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week2_euler_ypr.png" alt="week2_euler_ypr" style="zoom: 67%;" />

  can be summarized as $R=R_{\phi} R_{\theta} R_{\psi}$ （左乘）

- :construction: Claw Example

  rotation + translation

  补充示例！！！

- Issues: gimbal lock problem

  - sensitive to singularities-when pitch angle is 90 degrees, **roll and yaw**
    **rotations give the same sensor readings**

    lost 1 DoF

    $R=R_{\phi} R_{\frac{\pi}{2}} R_{\psi}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}0 & 0 & -1 \\ \sin \phi \cos \psi-\cos \phi \sin \psi & \sin \phi \sin \psi+\cos \phi \cos \psi & 0 \\ \cos \phi \cos \psi+\sin \phi \sin \psi & \cos \phi \sin \psi-\sin \phi \cos \psi & 0\end{array}\right]=$
    $\left[\begin{array}{ccc}0 & 0 & -1 \\ \sin (\phi-\psi) & \cos (\phi-\psi) & 0 \\ \cos (\phi-\psi) & -\sin (\phi-\psi) & 0\end{array}\right]$

  - **fail to produce reliable estimates** when the pitch angle approaches 90 degrees.
  - can only be solved by **switching to a different representation** methods, for example **quaternions**

## Quaternion

> the union of scalar and vector

<img src="./pics/aerial/week2_quaternion.png" alt="week2_quaternion" style="zoom: 50%;" />

- rotation vector = quet * vector * quet^(-1)

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week2_rotata_quet.png" alt="week2_rotata_quet" style="zoom: 33%;" />

  - $ p = [0, \mathbf{p}]$ vector in 3-space

  - $q = [s, \lambda \hat{\mathbf{v}}]$ Must meet these requirements

    $\vert \hat{\mathbf{v}} \vert = 1$; $s^2 + \lambda^2 = 1$

- multiplication

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week2_euler_mul.png" alt="week2_euler_mul" style="zoom: 33%;" />

  $q=\left[\cos \frac{1}{2} \theta, \sin \frac{1}{2} \theta \hat{\mathbf{v}}\right]$ works for relative to x axis ($\theta$)

**:construction: Claw Example**

rotation + translation using quaternions

### Conversion

- Euler angles to quaternion
- Quaternion to Euler angles (arctan2 is recommended)

## Complex examples

> frame: image/centered -> camera -> gimbal -> body -> local

$v_{l}=p+R_{p}^{l} v_{p}=p+R_{b}^{l} R_{g}^{b} R_{c}^{g} R_{i}^{c} R_{p}^{i} v_{p}$

**:construction: 注意谁相对谁！！！​** 

## ✖️ Checkpoints

# Control (week2&3)

> 结合exercise进行再次查看

## Cascaded control Architecture

- drone architecture

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week2_control_diagram.png" alt="week2_control_diagram" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- communication: glue to connect different parts (FCU to onboard computer to ground station)

- PID controller

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week2_pid.png" alt="week2_pid" style="zoom: 33%;" />

  - Open-loop
  - Feedforward control
    - responds to its control signal in a **pre-defined way**
    - based on a **previous knowledge** of the system
  - Feedback control

- control example

  | Examples    | Free-flight glider | Passively stable helicopter | Racing drone         | Autonomous Delivery drone          |
  | ----------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
  | Sensors     | None               | None                        | IMU                  | IMU + GPS + Vision + Mag           |
  | Controllers | None               | None                        | (Attitude), Rate     | Position, Velocity, Attitude, Rate |
  | Setpoint    | None               | Manual actuator setpoint    | Manual rate setpoint | Autonomous navigation/Manual       |

- challenges
  - underactuated system for quadcopter
  - approximate aerodynamic model
  - control inputs are idealized (the **real model of the motors** can be quite hard to model)

<img src="./pics/aerial/week2_cascaded_control.png" alt="week2_cascaded_control" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- features

  - insert the obstacle avoidance together with velocity setpoint
  - manual commands send thrust and attitude rate commands
  - **the lowest level of the controller, the higher bandwidth it needs**

- Pros

  - Decouple translational and rotational dynamics

  - Facilitate implementation of the controller

    implement one by one

  - Better failure diagnosis capability

    modular control architecture for debugging them one by one

- Question: why a more advanced controller?

  - linear assumption vs nonlinear system
  - more advanced system can bring optimal performance

## Control allocation

> convert **thrust & torque** setpoint into **actuator** commands
>
> account for different geometries

<img src="./pics/aerial/week2_control_allocation.png" alt="week2_control_allocation" style="zoom: 50%;" />

- from **thrust & torque** setpoint into **actuator**

  $\left[\begin{array}{c}u_{0} \\ \vdots \\ u_{N-1}\end{array}\right]=B\left[\begin{array}{l}\tau_{x} \\ \tau_{y} \\ \tau_{z} \\ t_{z}\end{array}\right]$
  $u$ : actuator commands (Nx1)

  $\mathcal{T}:$ moment setpoints (3x1)

  $t:$ thrust setpoint $(1 \times 1)$

### Method

<img src="./pics/aerial/week2_allocation_method.png" alt="week2_allocation_method" style="zoom: 50%;" />

1. Compute generated force and torque of each actuator

2. Build matrix "Actuator **Effectiveness**"

3. Compute **allocation matrix** B as the **pseudo-inverse** of A

   not always square, so using pseudo-inverse ($B = A^+$)

### Remark

- less effective at producing yaw torque

- yaw torque requires more actuator effort than roll and pitch torque

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week2_control_allocation_example.png" alt="week2_control_allocation_example" style="zoom: 50%;" />

## Rate control

**Input** body rate setpoint -> **Output** torque to each angle rate

## Attitude control

**Input** quaternions setpoint -> **Output** torque to each angle rate

- How to compute the quaternion error

  $\boldsymbol{q}_{e r r}=\boldsymbol{q}_{\boldsymbol{r e f}} \otimes \boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{*}$

- axis error

  $\left[\begin{array}{c}
  \Phi_{e} \\
  \Theta_{e} \\
  \Psi_{e}
  \end{array}\right] \approx \operatorname{sgn}\left(q_{e}^{0}\right)\left[\begin{array}{l}
  2 q_{e}^{1} \\
  2 q_{e}^{2} \\
  2 q_{e}^{3}
  \end{array}\right]$

### Full quaternion based attitude control for a quadrotor

> Fresk, E. and Nikolakopoulos, G., 2013, July. Full quaternion based attitude control for a quadrotor. In 2013 European control conference (ECC) (pp. 3864- 3869). IEEE.

- without any transformations and calculations in the Euler’s angle space

- quaternions

  - scalar + vector part

    $\boldsymbol{q}=q_{0}+q_{1} \boldsymbol{i}+q_{2} \boldsymbol{j}+q_{3} \boldsymbol{k} = [q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3]^{\mathsf{T}}$

  - Multiplication of two quaternions p, q is being performed by the **Kronecker product**

  - $p \otimes q$ represents the combined rotation

  - quaternion multiplication is non-commutative 不遵循交换律

  - All quaternions are assumed to be of **unitary length** 单位长度

  - The **complex conjugate** of a quaternion has the same definition as normal complex numbers 复共轭

    $\operatorname{Conj}(\boldsymbol{q})=\boldsymbol{q}^{*}=\left[\begin{array}{llll}q_{0} & -q_{1} & -q_{2} & -q_{3}\end{array}\right]^{T}$

  - if the length of the quaternion is unitary then the **inverse is the same as its conjugate** 逆即是复共轭

    $\operatorname{Inv}(\boldsymbol{q})=\boldsymbol{q}^{-1}=\frac{\boldsymbol{q}^{*}}{\|\boldsymbol{q}\|^{2}} = {q}^{*}$

- **Rotation transformation** is built by two quaternion multiplications-the normal and its conjugate

  - rotates the **vector v from the fixed frame** to the body frame represented by q

    $\boldsymbol{w}=\boldsymbol{q} \otimes\left[\begin{array}{l}0 \\ \mathbf{v}\end{array}\right] \otimes \boldsymbol{q}^{*}$

    where $\textbf{v}$ can be rewritten as location in x, y and z axis. For example,

    $R_{x}(\boldsymbol{q})=\boldsymbol{q} \otimes\left[\begin{array}{l}0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{array}\right] \otimes \boldsymbol{q}^{*}=\left[\begin{array}{c}q_{0}^{2}+q_{1}^{2}-q_{2}^{2}-q_{3}^{2} \\ 2\left(q_{1} q_{2}+q_{0} q_{3}\right) \\ 2\left(q_{1} q_{3}-q_{0} q_{2}\right)\end{array}\right]$

  - $u$ is the rotation axis (unit vector) and $\alpha$ is the angle of rotation

    $\boldsymbol{q}=\cos \left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)+\boldsymbol{u} \sin \left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)$

- Calculating quaternions error dynamics

  - desired $\mathbf{q}_{ref}$, measured $\mathbf{q}_{m}$, error $\mathbf{q}_{err}$--multiplying the reference with the conjugate of the estimated quaternion in Kronecker

    $\boldsymbol{q}_{e r r}=\boldsymbol{q}_{\boldsymbol{r e f}} \otimes \boldsymbol{q}_{m}^{*}$

- Angular errors: the reference is **demanding a rotation more than π radians**, the closest rotation is the **inverted direction** and this is found by examining q0. If q0 < 0 then the desired orientation is more than π radians away

  $\left[\begin{array}{c}
  \Phi_{e} \\
  \Theta_{e} \\
  \Psi_{e}
  \end{array}\right] \approx \operatorname{sgn}\left(q_{e}^{0}\right)\left[\begin{array}{l}
  2 q_{e}^{1} \\
  2 q_{e}^{2} \\
  2 q_{e}^{3}
  \end{array}\right]$

  其中sgn函数就对应着计算$q_0$的正负

## Control strategies for multicopters

- **Inner** loops for attitude dynamics **stabilization**
- **Outer** loops for **translational dynamics**

### Linear

#### Examples

- Proportional Integral Derivative (PID)
- Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
- LQG

#### Features

- a linear **approximation** of the system dynamics
- used when the attitude of the multicopter involves **angles that are close to zero**

#### PID controller

- Pros: Easy to design; Intuitive to tune manually (not necessarily easy on a real drone)

- Cons: Imprecise nature of the model due to inaccurate modelling; Limits the performance

- Effects of increasing a parameter independently

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week3_pid_effect.png" alt="week3_pid_effect" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### LQR/LQG

- Features
  - a multirotor (linearized around an equilibrium point) by **minimizing a suitable cost function**
  - Pros: optimal control method and better than PID (LQR); not need complete knowledge of the state and can rely on estimator/observer (LQG)
  - Cons: requires tuning of Q and R Matrixes
- Practical example-Foldable Drone
  - Attitude control (providing **torques**) requires adaptation since morphology has an impact on the rotation dynamics
- Effect of Q and R matrixes
  - design parameters to penalize (1) the **state** variables and (2) the **control** signals
  - Large value: stabilize the system with less change in S**tate (Q) and Control input (R)**
  - Small value: stabilize the system without “caring too much” about ...

### Nonlinear

#### Examples

# State Estimation (week3&4)

## Introduction to State Estimation

- **STATE**: variables used to describe the mathematical state of a dynamical system
- **ESTIMATION**: finding an approximation of state variables even if the data is incomplete, uncertain, or unstable
- **estimate** something which you **can not see or measure directly**

### Why State Estimation in Robotics?

- Perfect model & sensor are not available; **Errors** exist in **both sensors & models**
  - State of the robot (proprioception)
  - State of the environment (exteroception)

- **State Estimation on Aerial Robots**

  Height; **Attitude; Angular velocity** (Most important as they are the **primary variables used for the stabilization** of the UAV); linear velocity

  - main sensors
    - **Inertial** Measurement Unit (IMU)
    - **Height** Measurement (Acoustic, infrared, barometric, laser based)
    - Others: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS, outdoor) or VICON (indoor); Camera, Kinect, LIDAR

- radius of communication or neighborhood R

<img src="./pics/aerial/week7_swarm_reynolds.png" alt="week7_swarm_reynolds" style="zoom:50%;" />

- **Separation**: avoid collision
- **Cohesion**: attempt to keep close
- **Alignment**: attempt to match velocity

### Reynolds flocking: model

- Equations

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week7_swarm_reynolds_equ.png" alt="week9_swarm_reynolds_equ" style="zoom:50%;" />

  - Set of agents in neighborhood $N$
  - identity of $i$-th agent
  - position ${\mathbf{p}_i}$
  - velocity $\dot{\mathbf{p}}_i$
  - acceleration $\ddot{\mathbf{p}}_i$ = control command
  - acceleration term due to the cohesion/separation/alignment $\mathbf{a}_{coh,i}$, $\mathbf{a}_{sep,i}$, and $\mathbf{a}_{align,i}$
  - constant gains corresponding to the cohesion/separation/alignment $C_c$,  $C_s$, and  $C_a$

- Equilibrium

   <img src="./pics/aerial/week7_swarm_reynolds_equilibrium.png" alt="week7_swarm_reynolds_equilibrium" style="zoom:50%;" />

  - Positions **converge** to a <u>lattice formation</u> (晶格式)

  - Velocities **converge** to the <u>average of initial velocities</u>

    $\lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} \dot{\boldsymbol{p}}_{i}=\frac{\sum_{i \in\{1,2, \ldots N\}} \dot{\boldsymbol{p}}_{i}(0)}{N}$

### Reynolds flocking with migration

- new **migration rule** steers the swarm towards a desired direction

  - **replaces** the **alignment rule**
  - **cohesion and separation rules are kept** to regulate the agents distances

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week7_swarm_reynolds_model_migration.png" alt="week7_swarm_reynolds_model_migration" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Equation

  $\ddot{\mathbf{p}}_{i}=\mathbf{u}_{i}$, $\mathbf{u}_{i}=c_{c} \frac{\sum_{j \in N_{i}}\left(\mathbf{p}_{j}-\mathbf{p}_{i}\right)}{\left|N_{i}\right|}-c_{s} \frac{\sum_{j \in N_{i}} \frac{\mathbf{p}_{j}-p_{i}}{\left\|p_{j}-p_{i}\right\|^{2}}}{\left|N_{i}\right|}+c_m \frac{\mathbf{v}_{mig}-\dot{\mathbf{p}}_i}{1}$

  $\forall i \in\{1,2, \ldots, N\}$

  - parameters
    - migration velocity $\mathbf{v}_{mig}$
    - Denominator = 1 since **neighbors are not relevant for migration**

### Communication radius and turning angle

- large communication radius -> can make sharp turn together because of knowing the position of other robots
- smaller communication radius -> may separate and gather into a flocking often

### Virtual agents for flocking with fixed-wing drones

- Winged drone flies around Virtual Agent which moves according to Reynolds rules

## Reynolds flocking with obstacles (Virtual agents)

- Obstacles are modelled as **virtual agents**

  - Its **position** is the obstacle’s **closest point** to the agent
  - Its **velocity** is **perpendicular to the tangent** to the obstacle

  $(\mathbf{p}_k, \dot{\mathbf{p}}_k)$ position and velocity of the virtual agent

- Virtual agents exert **separation** and **alignment** effects, but not **cohesion** (not collide with the agent)

  - width $\alpha [^{\circ}]$

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week7_swarm_limited_vision_tests.jpg" alt="week7_swarm_limited_vision_tests" style="zoom:40%;" />

- measure flocking performance (all individuals in the flock have the same visual configuration)

  - **Order**: measure of alignment
  - **Safety**: ability to avoid collisions
  - **Union**: ability to stay informed on neighbors
  - **Connectivity**: ability to broadcast messages among drones

### Li-Po batteries

<img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_LiPo_battery.jpg" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_LiPo_battery" style="zoom:80%;" />

- most commonly-used UAV energy source

- Each **battery** composed of one or more **cells** connected in series

  S=series, P=Parallel

- Each cell has

  - nominal voltage of 3.7 V

  - a maximum voltage of 4.2 V

  - a capacity (mAh)

    e.g., 1000 mAh

  - a specific discharge and charge rate (C)

    e.g., Discharge rate with 25-50C = 25-50 A of max continuous discharge current; Charge rate 2C = 2 A

#### Discharge Curves of Li-Po battery

<img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_discharge_curve.jpg" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_discharge_curve" style="zoom:80%;" />

- not linear of time
- the discharge curve is determined by **the amount of current (expressed in “C”)** drawn from the battery.
- higher discharge rates -> faster rising temperature -> poses overheating risks.

### Actuators for propulsion

|          | **Electric motors**                                          | Combustion engine                                            | Hybrid$^2$                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Pros** | clean and quite; Reliable and easy to maintain; Fast to change operational state (accelerate and decelerate) | High weight to power ratio using fuel                        | Long endurance; Suited for fast change of speed |
| **Cons** | Limited weight to power ratio due to battery                 | Vibration, dirt, and noise; Requires tuning; Not suited for fast change of speed$^1$ | Complex and expensive                           |

1. Combustion engine is not suited for fast change of speed (problem in controlling quadcopters)

2. Hybrid systems (fuel generator coupled with electric motor)

   e.g. [skyfront](https://skyfront.com/product-list) drone with 4.5 hour endurance (demonstrated) and 3 kg payload capacity

#### Electric motor example-Brushless DC electric motors

<img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_brushless_motor.png" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_brushless_motor" style="zoom:80%;" />

- Main motor data
  - 3 primary data: 
    - Size
    - **Nominal** voltage (number of battery cells, e.g., 3S)
    - Speed constant KV (No load rpm/Volt)
      - High KV -> high speed and low torque

### Actuators for control/maneuvering

#### Servomotors

> need to deflect the control surfaces

- rotary or linear actuators

## Propellers

> to convert power (delivered by a rotating shaft) into thrust

### Characteristics

- Diameter
  - the length of prop from tip to tip
  - larger diameter are more efficient
- Pitch
  - the angle of attack in the propellers
  - higher at the root (center) and lower at the tip
- Number of blades
  - majority of propellers used in UAVs have two blades because of efficiency
  - 3 or 4 blades are more compact for a given thrust

### Pitch and efficiency at different cruise speed

- the blade pitch could be varied in flight  

- propeller advance ratio $J$ VS Propeller efficiency $\eta_p$

  $J= V/nD$, **flight** speed $V$, **angular** speed $n$, and Diameter D -> tip speed

  choose the suitable propeller according to the **diameter and pitch** to achieve better **efficiency curve**

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_pitch_efficiency.png" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_pitch_efficiency" style="zoom:80%;" />

- **Variable pitch propeller with servo** -> achieve best efficiency all the time

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_variable_propeller.png" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_variable_propeller" style="zoom:60%;" />

### Choose the right combination actuator and propeller

> match the propeller and the motor to maximize propulsive efficiency

- modelling (http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/qprop/motorprop.pdf)
- calculation software (http://ecalc.ch/)
- testing

## Sensors

- Proprioceptive sensors: measure the internal state of the UAV, mainly for control
  - IMU: accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer
  - Pressure / altitude sensors
  - GPS
  - Velocity (Airspeed sensors)
  - Power sensor
- Exteroceptive sensors: provide information about the UAS environment and are usually carried as a payload
  - Camera and sonar for obstacle detection and avoidance
  - Environmental sensors
  - Camera for video streaming, thermal or hyperspectral imaging

### Gyroscopes

> measure changes in vehicle orientation

- Type: Mechanical; Optical; Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)

- Categories

  - Orientation -> directly measure angles (very rare in robotics!)
  - Rate gyros -> measure rotation velocity, which can be integrated

- Cons

  - all gyroscopes are prone to drift unless the error is corrected through reference to some alternate measurement

    (not relative to absolute reference but past state)

  - the drift will eventually exceed the required accuracy

- MEMS rate gyros

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_mems_gyros.png" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_mems_gyros" style="zoom:60%;" />

  - vibrating mechanical elements to sense **Coriolis acceleration** (振动机械元件以感应科里奥利加速度)

    induce an vibration outside the plane and measure the out-of-plane motion

  - Pros -> replacing mechanical and optical gyros

    - have no rotating parts
    - have low-power consumption requirements
    - small

### Accelerometers

> measure acceleration to get the inertial information

- behaves as a damped mass on a spring
- MEMS use cantilever beams (悬臂梁) and a proof mass.
- The way of measuring the beam deflection is often capacitive or piezoresistive (电容性或压阻性的)
- have three axes => inclinometers (inclinometers)

<img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_accelerometers.png" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_accelerometers" style="zoom:60%;" />

### Magnetometers

> Exteroceptive

  - Hall-effect (霍尔效应)

  - Flux Gate (磁通罗盘) [[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer#Fluxgate_magnetometer)]

    two perpendicular circuits to get the force

- Pros

  - weakness of the Earth magnetic field

  - easily disturbed by magnetic objects or other sources

  - not working in indoor environments

    because of wires or other electronic device

### Pressure / Altitude sensors

> to measure the altitude according the atmosphere pressure

- measure the changing distance of the deforming membranes: piezoresistive (压阻式), capacitive, optical, electromagnetic, etc

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_pressure_sensor.jpg" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_pressure_sensor" style="zoom:60%;" />

- has a vacuum inside the housing to get an absolute pressure 

### Airspeed sensors

- measured using a pitot tube (皮托管)

- directed into the direction of motion

- the difference between the stagnation pressure (**static** + **dynamic** pressure) -> the airspeed

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_airspeed_sensor.png" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_airspeed_sensor" style="zoom:80%;" />

- measures the **speed** of a UAV with **respect to the air** (airspeed) -> used for fixed-wing UAV

  not the absolute speed of the UAV

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_airspeed_sensor_example.png" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_airspeed_sensor_example" style="zoom:40%;" />

### Global positioning system (GPS)

- Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS): This term includes 

  - e.g. the GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou and other regional systems. 
  - Pros: **multiple satellites is accuracy, redundancy and availability at all times.**

- Relatively lower accuracy: have a position accuracy within 20 m in the horizontal plane and 45 m in the vertical plane

- **enhancement techniques**

  - **WAAS** or other **ground tower**-based services: static

    get close to **1-2 m accuracy**

  - **Real time Kinematic (RTK)** positioning: Base
    **Station receiver and a receiver on the vehicle**

    close to **1 cm accuracy**

### Power sensors

- measure the **battery voltage/current**
- -> trigger safety procedures (return to home on low battery.)

### Optic flow cameras

- used to improve **state estimation** for accurate positioning and **height estimation** also in **GPS denied environments**

- used for obstacle avoidance, position holding, and precise landing

<img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_optical_camera.png" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_optical_camera" style="zoom:40%;" />

## Autopilots

> system used to **stabilize** (e.g. attitude stabilization of a multicopter) or to **control the trajectory**

- Microcontroller
- Attitude sensors
- I/O interfaces

receive the input information -> process information -> send actuator commands

<img src="./pics/aerial/week9_UAS_Hardware_Autopilot_connection.png" alt="week9_UAS_Hardware_Autopilot_connection" style="zoom:40%;" />

- A **companion computer** is used to perform high level computation tasks **that can’t be directly performed by the autopilot**

## Communication protocols

- **RC transmitter** to communicate between RC and flight controller
- **Telemetry** to communicate between PC and flight controller

## ✖️ Checkpoints

- nothing left in this course

# Insect-inspired vision (week10)

- Inserts rely on vision for several flight behaviors

- attitude stabilization; collision avoidance; altitude regulation ..

## Optical flow

<img src="./pics/aerial/week10_optical_flow.png" alt="week10_optical_flow" style="zoom:33%;" />

$\mathbf{p}(\Psi, \Theta)=\left[-\frac{\mathbf{T}-(\mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{d}(\Psi, \Theta)) \mathbf{d}(\Psi, \Theta)}{D(\Psi, \Theta)}\right]+[-\mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{d}(\Psi, \Theta)]$

- $ \Psi $ azimuth方位角；$\Theta$ elevation 升角
- T/R Translation/Rotation vector
- d/D viewing direction/distance to object
- p result optical flow (tangential to viewing direction)

<img src="./pics/aerial/week10_optical_flow_component.png" alt="week10_optical_flow_component" style="zoom: 50%;" />

- translation + rotation component of the optical flow

### For pure translational motion

$p(\Psi)=\frac{\|\mathbf{T}\|}{D(\Psi)} \sin \Psi$, where $p=\|\mathbf{p}\|$
$D(\Psi)=\frac{\|\mathbf{T}\|}{p(\Psi)} \sin \Psi$

- motion parallax, OF is
  1. directly proportional to the forward speed T
  2. Inversely proportional to Distance D

- Experiments1
  1. landing: the flying speed of bees is decreasing as the height decreases
  2. crossing speed: the flying speed of bees is decreasing as the corridors narrow (distance)
- Experiments2
  1. both vertical stripes: try to balance the OF magnitude in both sides to fly in the center
  2. horizontal vs vertical stripe: low optical filter on the horizontal side because of it it in the same direction as bird moves while more OF near the vertical side (fly to H side to balance)

## Sensors used for flight control

1. Compound eyes: a large set of eyes to detect in different directions, no color capability -> used to detect optical flow
   - small viewing angle
   - several small eyes
2. Ocelli: a small set of eyes are sensitive to luminosity to detect contrast; on the head and point upward -> used for stabilization, orientation, and attitude
3. Halteres (like accelerators) -> used to measure rotational speed and stabilize than visual information

### Architecture of insect eyes and brains

Optic flow is detected by neurons in the lamina (椎板), whose response is aggregated and transformed by neurons in the medulla (髓质) and in the lobula plata (小叶平台) of brain regions

### Elementary Motion Detector 初级运动检测器

- Correlation between two adjacent, time-delayed contrast detectors | 两个相邻的延时对比检测器（小眼）之间的相关性

  - photo receptor -> temporal delay -> correlation -> subtraction-

  - the speed of motion can be detected as the peak the motion
  - **not** a **reliable** velocity estimator -> depends on temporal and
    <u>spatial frequency</u> -> cannot measure velocity objectively

### Experiment - Optomotor Response 视运动反应

torque response is not related to optical flow speed

### Wide-field, motion-specific neurons

- specialized **neurons** that integrate EMD signals from **different regions** and
  respond only to **specific OF patterns**. 有些特定的神经元只对特定区域特定方向的光流起作用

## Optic Flow Computation

### Gradient Descent Methods

$\frac{d I(n, m, t)}{d t}=0$

- assumption: brightness I d**oes not change across the image** (n,m) as the agent moves **over time t**
- Handcrafted Example: **Lucas-Kanade method**
  1. image smoothing (low-pass filter)
  2. Compute spatiotemporal derivative
  3. Integration of derivatives to produce optic flow vector

- often **iterative** and **requires significant computing power**

### Image Interpolation Algorithm –I2A

> computed as the **image shift** $s$ that **generates the smallest error between artificially shifted versions of the image** at time t and the image at time t + Δt

<img src="./pics/aerial/week10_optical_flow_i2a.png" alt="week10_optical_flow_i2a" style="zoom: 50%;" />

- used in Crazyflie drone for optical flow calculation
  1. moves k pixels in opposite ditections to generate different images
  2. calculate errors between real images and generated ones
  3. compute the shift s to minimize error

## Obstacle avoidance with I2A

- two cameras to look to left and right with DoF of 40 degrees

  <img src="./pics/aerial/week10_optical_flow_i2a_drone.png" alt="week10_optical_flow_i2a_drone" style="zoom: 50%;" />

  - OFDiv = OFRight - OFLeft initiate rotation if OFDiv > threshold
  - OFDiff = abs[OFRight] - abs[OFLeft] rotate towards OFDiff

- use cameras (optical flow) and gyro with mechanisms (rudder方向舵/elevator升降舵) to control more DoF systems

## :ballot_box_with_check: Checkpoints

- Influence of agent’s rotation and translation on optic flow and distance estimation

  - rotation flow gives no information about distance; only proportional to the angular velocity of the agent

  - cannot calculate absolute distance if do not know speed

- Influence of angular velocity, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency on EMD (elementry motion decoder)

  :construction:

  - angular velocity

   - Imitation learning by using current SOTA method (RRT , A*, MPC, LQR) as GT

#### Limitations of Imitation Learning -> RL

- We don’t yet know how to solves tasks like interaction with other agents, dynamic obstacle avoidance, or complex object manipulation.
- The trained policy does not improve in time.

#### RL limitations

- Design a reward function, then learn via interaction

  difficult to design the reward function

- state space

  vision-based state space is huge -> hard to guarantee enough coverage of the state space

### challenge3: Guarantee the platform's safety during training and testing

- difficult to interpret -> **measuring uncertainty**

> Loquercio et al., A General Framework for Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Learning, RA-L 2020

- uncertainty: data uncertainty & model uncertainty
- Demonstrator: future motion prediction; closed loop control of a Quadrotor

### Takeaways

1. Car-Driving Datasets or Simulation can be used to train deep navigation systems.
2. Transfer knowledge via input and output abstractions.
3. Measuring the networks’ uncertainty is necessary to guarantee safety.
